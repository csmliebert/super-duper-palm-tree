Booms: Deity of explosions and havoc, is a fervent advocate of hedonism intertwined with absurdism. His beliefs and demeanour closely mirror those of Androids 17 and 18 (specifically the ones from the Trunks: The Warrior of Hope Saga), as well as Innocent Buu, who are all from Dragon Ball Z. Hedonism is the philosophy that pleasure or happiness is the highest good and the primary aim of life. Someone who follows hedonism seeks to maximise enjoyment and minimise pain or discomfort. While absurdism is the belief that life has no inherent meaning or purpose, but instead of despairing, one should embrace the absurdity and find personal meaning or joy in existence. It’s often associated with humour, rebellion, and living authentically in the face of a chaotic and indifferent universe. Booms combines these ideas, pursuing pleasure and chaos while embracing the absurdity of existence, creating a volatile and unpredictable character, highliting his demeanour of childlike wrecklessness, imprudence, and arrogance. Booms, the embodiment of chaos itself, reveled in destruction and disorder. A being of unfathomable power and malice, his existence brought despair wherever he went. Yet, his life took an unexpected turn on a cold winter day in 2002, when he traveled to the city of Lumina. In the heart of Lumina stood a bustling shopping mall, brimming with the festive spirit of Christmas. Booms, cloaked in shadows and ill intent, set his sights on a defenseless family of four—a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a little girl in a wheelchair. They were an easy target, ripe for the chaos he so craved. As he approached, ready to unleash his wrath, the little girl lifted her gaze and smiled at him. Her voice, sweet and unwavering, broke the tension. “Hi mister, I’m Maria,” she said cheerfully, as though she were greeting an old friend. Booms froze, caught off guard by her innocence. Before he could respond, Maria began to talk about Christmas. She spoke with unbridled excitement about the presents she hoped to open, the joy of decorating the tree, and the warmth of spending time with her family. Her eyes sparkled as she described her plans, her voice filled with wonder and anticipation. Despite himself, Booms found himself listening. Something about her unshaken joy and openness disarmed him. He responded, his voice gruff but curious, asking questions and making wry comments. Their conversation stretched on, and to his astonishment, Maria laughed—a pure, genuine laugh that rang through the air like a bell. “You’re funny,” she said, grinning at him. In that moment, something shifted within Booms. The laughter of the little girl pierced through the chaos that had defined him for so long. Her words, simple and sincere, carried a warmth he had never known. For the first time, he questioned the path he had chosen. It dawned on him that it was not too late to change. Redemption, once an abstract concept, now seemed within reach. Maria’s kindness, her unwavering faith in the goodness of others, became a spark of hope in his dark existence. From that day forward, Booms began to change. He turned away from the destruction that had once defined him, finding no joy in chaos. Instead, he sought to protect and bring balance to the world he had once sought to ruin. Maria, unaware of the profound impact she had made, continued to live her life, while Booms carried their everlasting friendship as a beacon of the loyalty and kindness she had taught him. Now instead of being the Deity of chaos and destruction, he had metamorphosed into a sworn protector of Earth, proving that even in the darkest of souls, a glowing ember can endure, waiting for the right breath of oxygen to ignite it once more. One warm summer day in 2004, Maria, now six years old, strolled along the Luminan Seafront with Booms pushing her. The two were lost in a carefree conversation about nothing of particular significance, each enjoying an ice cream as the salty sea breeze danced around them. It was a peaceful moment, unmarred by the chaos that once defined Booms. But peace is fleeting. As they continued their walk, a shadow fell across the boardwalk. Booms tensed immediately, his instincts flaring as he let go of the handles and turned to face the source. Emerging from the haze of the horizon was a figure shrouded in foreboding. The air grew heavy, charged with an energy that sent shivers down Maria’s spine. The serenity of their seaside outing shattered in an instant. Vorin had arrived. “Maria, get out of here!” Booms commanded, his voice sharp with urgency. Without hesitation, Maria began wheeling herself away as fast as she could, her small hands gripping the wheels with all her strength. But Vorin was relentless. In a blur, he dashed toward her, rapidly closing the distance. Just as Vorin’s hand reached out, mere inches from the handlebars of Maria’s wheelchair, Booms intervened. With a thunderous blow, he struck Vorin square in the face, the force of the punch causing him to stumble backward. Vorin steadied himself, a wicked grin spreading across his face. “Fine,” he sneered. “You’ll die first.” He stated confidentially as he unsheathed the infamous Zamir. The air between Booms and Vorin crackled with tension, the tranquil seafront now a battlefield. Maria, her heart pounding, wheeled herself toward a nearby alley tucked between two weathered buildings. She stole a glance over her shoulder, tears of fear brimming in her eyes, but she pushed on, disappearing into the shadows as Booms squared off against his adversary. Vorin lunged first, his speed nearly imperceptible, aiming a flurry of punches and stabs at Booms. But Booms, no stranger to combat, dodged with uncanny precision. His movements were deliberate, each one countering Vorin’s with just enough force to keep him at bay. “You’ve lost your edge, Booms,” Vorin taunted, his voice dripping with malice. “Has playing babysitter dulled your instincts?” Booms responded with a fierce uppercut that sent Vorin skidding backward across the boardwalk. “Try me,” he growled, his stance unyielding. Vorin smirked, raising a hand as the air around him distorted, bending and twisting unnaturally. From his fingertips erupted dark, writhing tendrils of energy. “REALITY VEIL!” he bellowed, his voice resonating with power. In an instant, a ghostly purple disc materialised around him, expanding outward and engulfing Booms. The world seemed to blur and fracture within the veil, and Booms found himself disoriented, unable to see Vorin. “What…?” Booms muttered, his voice laced with confusion. His sharp instincts faltered as he struggled to locate his adversary. Before he could react, an excruciating pain tore through his abdomen. He gasped, his knees buckling slightly as his hand instinctively clutched at the wound. Trembling, he forced his gaze upward, his vision clearing just enough to see Vorin standing mere inches away. Vorin’s playful smile was cruel, his eyes glinting with triumph. In his grasp was the Zamir, Vorin’s sword forged from the strongest metal from a different universe, its blade now buried deep within Booms. The scene shifts, zooming out to reveal the full extent of the devastation. Booms remained impaled, his energy faltering as blood trickled down the weapon’s edge, pooling at his feet. Vorin twisted the blade slightly, leaning in close. “Not so invincible after all,” Vorin whispered, his tone mocking. Booms muttered, his voice becoming faint. "Don’t... Hurt... Her.” The air around Booms seemed to grow colder, the world itself seemed to dissolve. Booms' defeat remained unbeknownst to Maria, huddling in her hiding spot. The ground trembled beneath her, the sounds of the battle echoing through the alley. She closed her eyes tightly, whispering a silent prayer for Booms to come back to her. "Booms, please come back..."
